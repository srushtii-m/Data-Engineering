## Data Engineering Process

Three main steps:

**1. Extract** 
Data extraction is getting data from multiple sources. Ex. Data extraction from a website using Web scraping or gathering information from the data that are stored in different formats(JSON, CSV, XLSX etc.).

**2. Transform** 
Transforming the data means removing the data that we don't need for further analysis and converting the data in the format that all the data from the multiple sources is in the same format.

**3. Load** 
Loading the data inside a data warehouse. Data warehouse essentially contains large volumes of data that are accessed to gather insights.

## Different File Formats

File format specifies
* whether the file is a binary or ASCII file.
* shows how the information is organized (tabular or plain text)

The different file formats are:
* Comma-separated values (CSV) file format
* JSON file Format
* XLSX file format
* XML file format
* Binary File Format
